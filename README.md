# Chess Project in Java ðŸ‡ºðŸ‡¸

This project was developed as part of the course "Java COMPLETO ProgramaÃ§Ã£o Orientada a Objetos + Projetos" taught by Prof. Dr. NÃ©lio Alves. The goal of this project is to apply the concepts learned in the course to build a chess game system in Java.

## Programming Fundamentals Used

### Java

- Java project creation
- Development environment setup
- Usage of control structures (if, else, loops)
- Exception handling
- Usage of collections (List, etc.)
- Working with classes and objects
- String manipulation

### Programming

- Programming logic
- Data structures (arrays, lists)
- Algorithm implementation

### Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)

- Encapsulation
- Constructors
- Inheritance
- Polymorphism
- Abstraction
- Interfaces
- Object-oriented exception handling
- SOLID principles
